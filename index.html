            <h2>Irish Gaelic – a cure for cancer?</h2>
            <b>Northern Irishman Éanna Mac Cana has said that learning Irish has helped him almost completely cure his rare cancer. </b>
            
            <p>The filmmaker was diagnosed with Burkitt’s lymphoma, a disease which affects the lymphatic system, in 2017 during his university years. The lump at the back of his throat was a “spanner in the works” for Mac Cana, but he has said that learning Irish for an upcoming film has heavily impacted his diagnosis – for the better. He has said that it was “through the Irish language that I was taking control again of my actual mouth.” </p>
            
            <p>Mac Cana first noticed a lump in the back of his throat during his first year of university at the University of Manchester in 2017. He hadn’t paid too much attention to it at first, due to the fact it was his first year of university and he was “partying hard,” assuming it was due to that. However, when the lump started bleeding, a biopsy confirmed he had Burkitt’s lymphoma and would have to be treated. He said it was a difficult time, and that he “wanted to get back to normal, but the ground had changed underneath me.” </p>
            
            <p>Finally, his treatment was over and in 2021, he was discharged from hospital. Following this, he decided to pick up a book by Dr Denis Burkitt, after whom Mac Cann’s disease was named and who discovered the cause of it whilst working in Uganda in the mid-20th century. </p>
            
            <p>Mac Cann gathered videos of Burkitt’s work and intended on making his own feature-length documentary about the doctor. He had previously completed some projects in Irish and set about learning the language again with his teacher Breandán Ó Fiach. The Irish language is obviously very different to English and has completely different sounds. </p>
            
            <p>“I was with Breandán one day and he was teaching about where to place certain syllables and how to access them.” said the filmmaker. “I remember saying certain words and I was using different parts of my mouth and it just felt like I was taking control of it again. [...] I owe the Irish language a lot." </p>
            
            <p>The film highlights Dr Burkitt’s work with children was described as “prophetic” by his daughter, Mrs Howard, who hopes he will be remembered “primarily as an Irishman, his heart was always in Ireland. [...] A man of faith and integrity and always asking the question why with his twinkly eyes and soft Irish voice… he could speak truth to power as a humble, good gentleman." </p>
            
            <b>Burkitt aired on TG4 on Wednesday 21 May at 21:30 BST. </b>
